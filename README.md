# Tic Tac Toe

This is a project within The Odin Project curriculum that I made.

In this project I tried to clean the code as much as possible by splitting the logic in separate functions and reusing them in other parts of the logic where it's needed. 

###### Game features:
- Character choice
- Message on the screen that informs about the outcome of the game
- Reset button for the game

###### What I used for the logic:
- Functions
- Arrow functions
- DOM Events
- Changing DOM attributes
- Destructuring
- Array Methods
- Spread Operator
- If Conditionals
- forEach Array loop

###### Styling:
- Body layout using Flexbox
- Gameboard using CSS Grid
